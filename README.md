# Enhancing Traffic Management Through Advanced Vehicle Detection and Congestion Prevention 

## Introduction  
Urban areas face significant challenges due to traffic congestion, leading to wasted time, increased fuel consumption, and economic inefficiencies. Traditional traffic systems often fail to adapt to dynamic traffic conditions. This project leverages the **YOLOv8s** deep learning model to develop a real-time vehicle detection system, addressing these challenges by identifying various vehicle classes in urban traffic scenarios.

## Model Evaluation  
The model's performance was assessed using various metrics across different vehicle classes:  

| Class          | Precision (%) | Recall (%) | mAP@0.5 (%) |  
|----------------|---------------|------------|-------------|  
| **Car**        | 83.5          | 80         | 85.8        |  
| **Two-Wheeler**| 69            | 74.1       | 77.1        |  
| **Auto**       | 73.3          | 45.7       | 49.9        |  
| **Bus**        | 68.2          | 50.7       | 61.0        |  
| **Truck**      | 68.4          | 47.8       | 57.7        |  
| **All Classes**| 72.5          | 59.7       | 66.3        |
